# Insertion_Sort Android App

## Overview
This Android app implements the **Insertion Sort** algorithm to sort an array of integers between 0 and 9. The app reads input, processes the sorting algorithm, and outputs the result while displaying intermediate steps of the sorting process.

The app runs until the user inputs 'quit' to exit. It is built with Java and uses Groovy DSL for build configuration.
